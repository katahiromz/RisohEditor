Question 1. What is "Risoh"?

    Answer. The word "Risoh" means "ideal" in Japanese.

Question 2. What are edt1, edt2, cmb1?

    Answer. Those are standard control ID macros defined in <dlgs.h>.

Question 3. What is mcdx?

    Answer. It's a special message compiler I made.
            See mcdx/MESSAGETABLEDX.md for details.

Question 4. Why did I get garbled characters when compiling with Visual Studio?

    Answer. The resource compiler of MSVC has a bug in treatment of
            UTF-8 resource files.

            Use UTF-16 (but UTF-16 is not supported in GNU windres).

Question 5. What is the difference between no installer and portable version?

    Answer. The portable version doesn't use registry but an ini file.

Question 6. Are the 64-bit files supported?

    Answer. Yes on 64-bit Windows. However WoW64 emulation layer prevents it
            loading from "C:\Program Files" or "C:\Windows\system32".
            You have to copy the 64-bit file into another place before loading.
